Welcome to your recipe generator. This small application was built using the Edamam API, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The idea came from my roommates when they mentioned being able to search an ingredient and recieve a list of recipes to go through. 
</p>

## Functionality
Search for one ingredient to get a list of 20 recipes. Click next to view the next recipe and previous to go back. If you are vegetarian, make sure you check the vegetarian box to only receive your desired recipes.
